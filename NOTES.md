# Turbo repo setup for Vite/Vue3

## Goal

Create a basic turborepo setup using Vue 3, Vite, Storybook and pnpm

- Vite is a lightening fast HMR server and bundler
  - originally written for Vue 3 but platform agnostic now
  - Vue plugin for vite enable `script setup` syntax for greatly improve experience in SFCs
  - Volar over Vetur for even better type safety especially in templates
- Storybook
  - Great design system to work with a component library
  -
## Tasks

- WARNING: Until https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/issues/962 is resolved you need to install Yarn as well

- Remove all React/NextJS autogenerated code
  - apps/*
  - packages/ui
  - packages/tsconfig/react-library.json
  - packages/tsconfig/nextjs.json
  - References to nextjs in various package.json and tsconfig files

- Configure new vite apps to use workspaces (in package.json, replace tsconfig with one that extends common configs, etc)

## Issues

- Storybook conflicts with Vue 3 and makes volar think that code in templates is JSX so you get errors about stuff like `class` shoudl be `className`
  - Needs to be fixed by setting `"types": ["vite/client"]` in tsconfig `compilerOptions` and adding `**/*.stories.ts` to the `excludes`
- Currently cannot import interfaces for `defineProps`/`defineEmits` in Vue script setup SFCs
